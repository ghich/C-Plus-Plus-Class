HW7  - Analysis and Design

MyString:
i. Adapt DynArray code to create a copy constructor

ii. Accessor - set a temp pointer to pStr
	Use pointer arithmetic(?) to return the character at a given position
	

iii. Resize utility - takes the size as a parameter and either shrink or expand the c-string
	 Will need to copy the original c-string to the other size.

iv. Add char function

v. isPalindrome

Hobbit
i. Set the name member variable to be a myString object
	Will need to include "mystring.h", and remove <string> to do this.
	Challenging to predict what it will take to implement this without getting started.

ii. Replace the age with birthYear.
	Will likely be find/replace to adapt this change.

iii. Create a function for the age of the hobbit
	Parameters: Current year
	Calculate the age of the hobbit (Current year - BirthYear) and return it.
