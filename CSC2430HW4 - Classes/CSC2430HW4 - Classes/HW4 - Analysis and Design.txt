Analysis and Design:

Inputs: Will take user input for each computer in array
Outputs: Formatted list of computers with the calculated value of the inventory
Formulas: (price of computer * on hand inventory)

Data Type inputs: (These are private in the header)
Model number = unsigned short
Manufacturer name = strign
CPU clock speed = float
Pricepoint of computer = float
Quantity on hand =  int

Header file Computer.h:
3 Constructors: One for compiler defaults, one for user initialized values, and one for initialized values except price and stock
6 Mutators: One for each value in the data type, and one to set them all
5 Accessors: One for each value in the data type. 
2 Utilities: One to output the values in the data type and the inventory value, and one to calculate the inventory value

Implementation file Computer.cpp:
Constructors: set user inputs to the data members.
	The third initializes price to 0.01, and quantity to 0.

Mutators: Modify each member of the data type to user input.
	Defaults:
	If clock speed is <= 0, set to 1.0
	If price set is <= 0, set to 0.01
	If inventory number is negative, default to 0.

Accessors: Return each specified data member.

Utilities: calcValue will return the inventory value via "return (stock * price);"
		outputData will take the datatype and output the data members + value to the screen for the user.


Client file client.cpp:
Will have an array for the computers (will use a global constant of 10--if the computer store wants to have a larger inventory later)
Will use a txt file to initialize the array.

And have a void function to output data that has descriptive formatting.
