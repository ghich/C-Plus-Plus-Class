HW3 Analysis and Design

Inputs: Take user input to assign characters to 3x3 matrices.
Outputs: Original matrix in a formatted output, and transposed matrix in a formatted output.
Formulas:
Constants: MAX_ROWS and MAX_COL each 3.

Design:
In the clientMain, it will include a header that is designed to do all of this by creating the datatype with a typedef.

In matrixRotation.h, which is the header file, there will be constants for rows and columns
Each should be int = 3.

matrixRotation.cpp will hold all the functions that the header calls.
 1. A function to initialize the 3x3 arrays.
	Use double for-loops for rows/columns
 2. A function to take user input for those arrays.
	If "q q q" is entered, stop taking input. 
	Unsure how to do this right now.
	If 'b' is entered, treat it as a space.
	for-loop to check and replace.
