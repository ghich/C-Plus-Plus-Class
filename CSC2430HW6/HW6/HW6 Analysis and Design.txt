Analysis and design

Integrating BOOL ISSORTED:
	First, integrate the bool isSorted as a private data member.
	Second, write it into the constructor to be false by default.
	Third, using the . operator from the original DynArray, copy over the bool in deepcopy.
		will look like isSorted = original.isSorted

Creating half size function
	Recycle some code from incSize function.
	Copy the original capacity to a temp called 'half' and divide by two.
	After setting temp to NULL, set the capacity to half.

Creating double size function
	Remove incSize and reSize.
	I believe the input of an unsigned int is optional, but because reSize used it
	keeping it in will make it an easier adaptation.

	Take the unsigned int of the capacity and multiply it by two.
	Copy original array using the copy function.
	delete pArr, set it as the temp array, and point the temp array to NULL.

	For debugging to be easier, I also want to initialize the elements in the empty 
	spaces in the array with 0's to make output cleaner using a for loop.

	Update capacity to the new capacity (timesTwo).
